# Why Identity Is the New Perimeter

As businesses adopt SaaS platforms and decentralized IT infrastructures, traditional network-based defenses are no longer enough. With **hundreds of apps** and **thousands of user identities** per organization, attackers are exploiting vulnerable accounts to bypass firewalls, endpoint detection tools, and other legacy defenses.

---

## Key Stats

- **600 million identity attacks** occur every day (*Microsoft*).
- **79% of web application compromises** stem from credential breaches (*Verizon*).

These staggering numbers highlight how critical identity security has become in today’s cybersecurity landscape.

## Key Attack Trends in 2024

### 1. **Snowflake Breach – A Watershed Moment**
- Attackers compromised accounts from **165 organizations** by leveraging stolen credentials from prior breaches.
- Data exfiltrated via SQL commands was sold on underground markets, impacting **millions of customers**.
- **What went wrong?** A lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) played a critical role.

### 2. **Evolving Threat Actor Tactics**
- **APT29 (Cozy Bear):** Sophisticated identity-based attacks targeting cloud infrastructure.
- **Scattered Spider:** Advanced social engineering and SIM-swapping techniques to infiltrate systems.
- **ShinyHunters:** Mass credential harvesting leading to large-scale SaaS account takeovers.

### 3. **Identity Exploitation Techniques**
- **MFA-bypassing phishing kits** using Adversary-in-the-Middle and Browser-in-the-Middle attacks.
- **Infostealers 2.0** leveraging advanced delivery methods to steal credentials and cookies.
- **Credential stuffing campaigns** fueled by massive dumps of breached credentials.
- **Session hijacking**, where stolen cookies allow attackers to bypass authentication entirely.

## Why This Matters

Identity attacks are not just a phase—they represent a **systemic shift** in how cybercriminals operate. 

Modern attackers don’t need to breach traditional networks anymore. All they need is a **valid login** to wreak havoc. The widespread adoption of SaaS platforms has created a vast, decentralized attack surface, where user accounts are often the weakest link.

## How Organizations Can Defend Themselves

To combat the growing wave of identity-based threats, organizations should prioritize these steps:

1. **Enforce strong MFA universally**, with an emphasis on phishing-resistant methods such as FIDO2 or WebAuthn.
2. **Monitor credential exposure** on the dark web and other underground markets.
3. **Deploy advanced tools for Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR)** to identify and mitigate identity-based attacks.
4. **Adopt Zero Trust principles**, particularly for SaaS environments.
5. **Educate employees** on secure practices to reduce phishing and social engineering risks.

## Looking Ahead to 2025

The lessons from 2024 are clear: **identity is now the core of cybersecurity**. Threat actors are refining their techniques, making identity-based attacks more sophisticated and harder to detect. 

Organizations must remain proactive, embracing modern security principles and technologies to stay ahead of these evolving threats.
