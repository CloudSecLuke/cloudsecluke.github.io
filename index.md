## üåê About Me

As a Senior Security Engineer with over a decade of experience, I focus on threat response and cloud security across enterprise-level environments, including Fortune 50 and Fortune 200 companies, smaller cloud-focused enterprises, and .mil environments. I have a strong background in cyber incident response, security infrastructure development, detection engineering, and compliance and audit support. My experience spans a wide range of technologies, such as AWS, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, SumoLogic, Splunk, and various Git repository services, all aimed at building and maintaining secure systems.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve developed a deep understanding of the cybersecurity landscape, especially within regulated environments like PCI, HIPAA, and FedRAMP. My mission is to empower businesses and individuals by sharing insights into modern security practices and demonstrating my expertise across multiple domains.

## üöÄ Projects and Contributions

### **OpenCTI Deployment**
I deployed OpenCTI via Docker on AWS using Terraform. This project showcases my ability to deploy threat intelligence platforms in cloud environments, with a focus on automation to streamline deployment and scalability.

### **Sports Analytics Modeling**
Developed statistical models to provide predictive analytics for betting odds based on historical trends, weather conditions, and other factors. I primarily use Python and Jupyter notebooks for this work.

## ***Coming Soon/ In-Progress***

### **Deployment of DetectionLab on Proxmox server**
The intent here will be to create and deploy a detection lab to Proxmox using Ansible, Packer and Terraform. Once the VMs are provisioned, tools such as Atomic Red Team and RedHuntOS will be used to generate telemetry on the endpoints for detection authoring. Zeek, Snort, Splunk, osquery, and Sigma will be used to analyze traffic and events to create high-fidelity detections.

## üåü Volunteer Work

I am committed to giving back to the community and have had the privilege of volunteering with the Ohio Cyber Reserve, a state-run initiative focused on improving local cybersecurity resilience. Through this work, I have:

- Assisted in cybersecurity assessments and remediation efforts for small businesses and local governments.
- Participated in cyber defense exercises and threat simulations, offering real-time incident response and remediation support.
- Collaborated with fellow cybersecurity professionals to enhance the digital security posture of Ohio‚Äôs critical infrastructure and local organizations.

This volunteer experience has allowed me to refine my skills, contribute to a meaningful cause, and actively protect the community from emerging cyber threats.

In addition, I'm also the founder of CodeBridge Cincinnati which is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit organization whose mission is to provide technological (coding courses, Chromebooks, computer lab materials, etc.) resources to underprivileged schools and individuals.
