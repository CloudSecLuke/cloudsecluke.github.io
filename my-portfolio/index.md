    <h1>Hi, I'm Luke Miller</h1>
    <p>I'm a seasoned Security Engineer with over a decade of experience specializing in threat response and cloud security across enterprise-level environments. My work spans a diverse range of organizations, including Fortune 50 companies, smaller cloud-focused enterprises, and .mil environments.</p>
<p>
I have a strong background in cyber incident response, security infrastructure development, detection engineering, and compliance and audit support. My expertise includes a wide array of technologies such as AWS, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, SumoLogic, Splunk, and various Git repository services. My goal is to build and maintain secure systems that are both resilient and scalable.</p>

<p>
Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve developed a deep understanding of the cybersecurity landscape, particularly within regulated environments like PCI, HIPAA, and FedRAMP. My mission is to empower businesses and individuals by sharing insights into modern security practices and showcasing expertise across multiple domains.</p>

<p>
I'm also a proud 12-year Air Force veteran with extensive experience in Cyber Effects (offensive cyber operations), Information Assurance, and Vulnerability Management. I currently hold a TS/SCI clearance with a CI Poly.</p>

<p>
Beyond my professional career, I'm a passionate volunteer committed to strengthening cyber resilience and bridging the digital divide. I contribute my time to the <a href="https://ohcr.ohio.gov/" target="_blank">Ohio Cyber Reserve</a>, where I help build cyber resilience within the community. Additionally, I am the founder of <a href="https://www.codebridgecincinnati.com" target="_blank">CodeBridge Cincinnati</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing technological and educational resources to underprivileged school districts in the Cincinnati metropolitan area.</p>

<p>
Our mission at CodeBridge Cincinnati is to close the "technological gap" faced by underprivileged students, empowering them with the skills and tools needed to thrive in a technology-driven world.
